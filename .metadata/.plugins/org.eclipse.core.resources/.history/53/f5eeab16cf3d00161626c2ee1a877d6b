These exercises involve using different JPA mapping annotations.

The HSQL in-memory database is used for all exercises.

The logging is configured to display the SQL statements (especially the DDL statements). For exercises that map to an existing RDBMS schema, it can be tested by using data manipulation statements (e.g. INSERT, UPDATE) and see if the column names match. For exercises that generate the schema (no existing database tables), there's no sure way to test if the mapping is correct (or as expected). In this case, the displayed DDL statements shall be inspected.
