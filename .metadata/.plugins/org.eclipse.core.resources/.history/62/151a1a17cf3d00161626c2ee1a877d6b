# Working with Persistent Objects (JPA)

These demos/exercises involve using different JPA `EntityManager` operations.

1. persist
2. find
3. merge
4. remove

Further exercises involve applying concurrency control.

The HSQL in-memory database is used for all exercises.

The logging is configured to display the SQL statements (including the DDL statements).
